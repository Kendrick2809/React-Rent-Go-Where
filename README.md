# Rent-Go-Where
A property guru inspired website that aims to help people look for places to rent and also look for tenants to share the rental unit with.

Image uploading is taken cared by imagekit.io, Ant Design components were used for sign up and log in page.

## User Stories
We put ourselves in the shoes of end users looking for a property to rent; these are just some thoughts we as ourselves when we think of what we need to do next.
As a user, I want to see what properties there are available before I even sign up an account.
As a user, I will want the sign up process to be easy. Not too many info to fill.
As a user, I will want the page to be redirected to log in after i signed up as a user.
As a user, I want to filter the apartment by rooms. Cos if you are broke like YX, 1 room is all you can afford but if hes dreaming, he filter by 5 rooms instead
As a user, I want to favorite properties I have shortlisted to keep an eye on it.
As a user, I want to make use of the site to list property to rent it out
As a user, I want photos uploaded as a picture when i list property so people can see how awesome it is renovated
As a user, I want to be able to edit the property details if i realise details are wrong
As a user , I want to delete the property entry if i dont want it listed anymore

Below are the userstories we started out going for but sadly due to time constraints we arent able to execute it:
As a user, I want to be able to look for others to rent the property with.
As a user, I want to be able to leave a comment on the property so other like minded tenants can communicate with me to share rental cost.(can be furthur broken down to smaller user stories)


## Difficulties
- conflicts when merging repository 
- Difficulty understanding documentation
- selective reading habit still bugs me. However compared to project 1 there are improvements else I wouldnt have solved PATCH route issues myself in 1.5hrs. 
- Tried to challenge myself in using tailwindcss when my bootstrap knowledge is also [Half-Bucket-Water](http://halfpailwater.weebly.com/), nevertheless tailwindcss feels amazing to use compared to my experience with bootstrap.(probably alrdy found comfort in an uncomfortable zone)

## Wins
- Getting uncomfortable doing a project with a new framework but quickly finding comfort in an uncomfortable zone(again).
- Gets experience working in a group, understanding each other differences and commitments in life and how to manage expectations so we do not be too hard on each other.
- Noticeable difference with volume of features produced compared to project 2.
- troubleshotting the current stack gets easier along the way
