# Rent-Go-Where
A property guru inspired website that aims to help people look for places to rent and also look for tenants to share the rental unit with.

Image uploading is taken cared by imagekit.io, Material UI components were used for sign up and log in page.

## User Stories
We put ourselves in the shoes of end users looking for a property to rent; these are just some thoughts we as ourselves when we think of what we need to do next.
* As a user, I want to see what properties are available before I sign up an account.
* As a user, I want the sign up process to be easy and not too many info to fill.
* As a user, I want the page to be redirected to log in after I signed up as a user.
* As a user, I want to filter the apartment by rooms. Cos if you are broke like YX, 1 room is all you can afford but if hes dreaming, he filter by 5 rooms instead
* As a user, I want to favorite properties I have shortlisted to keep an eye on it.
* As a user, I want to make use of the site to list property to rent it out
* As a user, I want photos uploaded as a picture when I list property so people can see how awesome it is renovated
* As a user, I want to be able to edit the property details if i realise details are wrong
* As a user , I want to delete the property entry if I dont want it listed anymore

Below are the userstories we started out going for but sadly due to time constraints we arent able to execute it:
* As a user, I want to be able to look for other user to rent the property with.
* As a user, I want to be able to leave a comment on the property so other like minded tenants can communicate with me to share rental cost.
* As a user, I want to be able to link the location in a map.
* As a user, I want to be able to make transaction through the platform.
* As a user, I want to be able to give or read testimonial between users and properties.

## Difficulties
- Conflicts when merging repository 
- Difficulty understanding documentation
- Time constraint on finishing our user stories.

## Wins
- Getting uncomfortable doing a project with a new framework but quickly finding comfort in an uncomfortable zone(again).
- Gets experience working in a group, understanding each other differences and commitments in life and how to manage expectations so we do not be too hard on each other.
- Noticeable difference with volume of features produced compared to project 2.
- troubleshotting the current stack gets easier along the way
